## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of the Southpaw Boxing Club website is to present information regarding the boxing club, for those interested in boxing themselves or for parents who are interested in their child(ren) attending boxing sessions.

### User Stories

### The Five Planes

I'll be utilising the Five Plane methodology by Jesse James Garrett during the development cycle of this project. This is to take the project from inception to final release, by dispersing the development of content and features over 5 interdependent planes to create a more fully realized product.

#### Strategy

The Strategy Plane will determine the reasoning for the website's existence.

<details>
  <summary>The Customer</summary>

- The primary demographic of the target audience, will be either male or female and be between the ages of 14 and 30 years old.
- The secondary demographic of the target audience, will be parents whose children are aged between 8 and 13 years old.

**Goals**

- The target audience wants to learn about the Southpaw Boxing Club, they want to get a feel for what the club represents and what it can do for them and/or their child regarding their personal boxing-related goals.
- They'll expect the website to be aesthetically pleasing, sporting a modern and sleek design in keeping with modern sport brand trends.
- The primary target audience will likely be uninterested with large portions of text, and will instead look for short and snappy snippets of information that are relevant to them and their visit.
- The secondary target audience will seek for more information regarding the boxing club, especially relating to how the boxing club trains children.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>The Business</summary>

- A website presenting information on the Southpaw Boxing Club is necessary, given that the target audience is on the younger end of the spectrum and they will expect a website along with an online presence on social platforms.
- Tech considerations must be undertaken given the target audience's young age range, as they will likely be mobile savvy. Therefore a mobile-first approach is necessary, as small screen sizes will likely be the most common way this website is experienced.

**Goals**

- The primary goal of the website from a business perspective, is to convince those partially interested in attending to attend the club's boxing classes, increasing profits from payments made on the door.

- The secondary goal of the website, is to help drive the club's online presence. Strong branding
