## User Stories Testing

As a new visitor & potential attendee, I want to:

- Discern whether the boxing club is suitable for my current level of experience.
  - The first paragraph within the home page immediately mentions that it's official guide is for people at all boxing levels.
  - The first paragraph within the boxing guide makes it's goals clear in preparing people of all levels for their first session with Southpaw.
- Quickly observe the public sessions, deducing as to which session is most suitable for my current goal.
  - A link to the sessions is immediately visible from the home page, which'll take the user directly to the sessions page.
  - The sessions are given a paragraph respectively, briefly detailing what goes on within each one, helping the user make an educated decision as to what session suits their goals.
- Be informed as to what clothing is appropriate for the boxing sessions.
  - A link to information regarding clothing is clearly shown at the intro section of the boxing guide, which'll immediately take the user to the clothing section.

As a new visitor who is a parent of a potential attendee, I want to:

- Understand the organisation and it's sessions in detail, to discern whether it's the right fit for my child.
  - A link to information regarding boxing for juniors with Southpaw is clearly shown at the intro section of the boxing guide, which'll immediately take the parent to the information regarding juniors.
  - The junior boxing section is essentially an FAQ, that attempts to answer the most common questions that are likely to be asked by parents. This informs the parent of Southpaw's methods in teaching boxing to juniors, helping them discern whether it's the right fit for their child.
- Be informed as to what clothing my child should wear when attending boxing sessions.

  - A link to information regarding clothing is clearly shown at the intro section of the boxing guide.

  - The sessions page has an aside section with days and times for each session respectively.
  - A link to see the address of the venue where the session is taking place, is visible in the aside section for each session respectively.

  - Links to each meaningful page (Boxing Guide, Sessions & Contact) is presented clearly in the home page and nav bar.

  - There are buttons to each meaningful section of the boxing guide within the intro section.
  - When clicked, the headers within the boxing guide open a dropdown menu. Links to immediately navigate to the section relevant to the user are provided within this dropdown menu.

- Be able to contact the organisation for any additional questions I may have.
